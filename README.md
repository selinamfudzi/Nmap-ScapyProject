# Nmap-ScapyProject
Nmap &amp; Scapy Lab Documentation

## 1. Introduction

As part of my Ethical Hacking coursework, I completed a practical lab focused on network scanning, service enumeration, and packet analysis using Nmap and Scapy.
The exercises were carried out in a controlled internal network, working with the target system at 10.6.6.23.
This lab helped me understand how cybersecurity professionals gather information during the reconnaissance phase of a security assessment. It reinforced how attackers map networks, identify services, and observe traffic patterns.

## 2. Lab Environment
   
**Machine: Linux / Kali Linux**

Tools Used:
Nmap
Scapy
Wireshark

Target: 10.6.6.23
Network: 10.6.6.0/24

## 3. Nmap Practical Work
3.1 Host Discovery (Ping Sweep)

**Command:**
``nmap -sn 10.6.6.0/24``

Purpose: Identify active hosts within the subnet.

Result: Host 10.6.6.23 was detected and confirmed to be online.

### 3.2 OS Detection

**Command:**
``sudo nmap -O 10.6.6.23``

Purpose: Estimate the operating system using TCP/IP fingerprinting.

Result: Nmap returned an OS guess based on collected fingerprints.

### 3.3 Service and Version Detection (FTP)

**Command:**
``nmap -p21 -sV -A -T4 10.6.6.23``

Purpose: Identify the FTP service, its version, and any additional related information.

Result: Nmap successfully detected the FTP service and relevant details useful for security assessment.

### 3.4 SMB Enumeration (Port 445)

**Command:**
``nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p445 10.6.6.23``

Purpose: Enumerate available SMB shares and look for misconfigurations.

Result: Returned a list of shares and highlighted possible issues.

### 3.5 Manual SMB Access Test

**Command:**
``smbclient //10.6.6.23/print$ -N``

Purpose: Test if anonymous SMB access is permitted.

Outcome: Anonymous login succeeded, indicating a potential security weakness.
(Exit using exit.)

## 4. Scapy Practical Work
Scapy was used entirely from the interactive shell.

### 4.1 Starting Scapy
sudo su
scapy

### 4.2 Sniffing All Traffic

**Command:**
sniff()

Purpose: Capture packets from the default network interface.

Traffic was generated by running:
ping google.com

Result: Scapy captured ICMP, DNS, and other packets.
To stop capturing: Ctrl + C

Store results:
paro = _
paro.summary()

### 4.3 Sniffing on a Specific Interface

**Command:**

sniff(iface="br-internal")

Purpose: Capture traffic specifically from the internal bridge network.

Traffic was triggered by:
Visiting 10.6.6.23 in a browser
Running network pings

Store results:
paro2 = _
paro2.summary()

### 4.4 Filtering ICMP Traffic

**Command:**
sniff(iface="br-internal", filter="icmp", count=5)

Triggered ICMP traffic using:
ping 10.6.6.23

Result: Captured exactly five ICMP packets.

Store and inspect:
paro3 = _
paro3.summary()
paro3[3]

## 5. Key Learnings

Nmap provides valuable information on active hosts, running services, and OS fingerprints.

SMB enumeration can reveal access issues or misconfigurations.

Scapy enables detailed packet analysis across different protocols.

Using filters improves the accuracy and relevance of captured data.

These exercises mirror the reconnaissance processes used in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

## 6. Conclusion

This lab enhanced my understanding of reconnaissance techniques using Nmap and packet analysis with Scapy. Performing host discovery, enumeration, and packet sniffing helped build practical skills that are essential for ethical hacking. The experience also reinforced the importance of thorough information gathering during the early stages of a penetration test.
